The purpose of this project is to build a 1:1 home cockpit for flying the Cessna Citation X aircraft in Flightgear. Flightgear is an open-source software (http://home.flightgear.org/).  

The Citation X that I use is the outstanding version developped by the PAF team (Patrouille de France).  
 - forum (in french) : http://equipe-flightgear.forumactif.com/
 - repository : https://sourceforge.net/projects/pafteam/

My project covers :
 - the drawings used for cutting the MDF sheets and build the cockpit,
 - the electronic schemas and PCB,
 - the code used in the microcontrolers (ESP-32 and Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro) for the inputs and outpus,
 - the code used in the Rasperry Pi Zero W for displaying the canvas on the screen.
 
 In the folder Electronics, you can find the backup files from EasyEDA.com. The project is available on https://easyeda.com/arnaud.dessein
