The purpose of this project is to build a 1:1 home cockpit for flying the Cessna Citation X aircraft in Flightgear.  
Flightgear is an open-source software that you can download on http://home.flightgear.org.  

The Citation X that I use is the outstanding version developped by the PAF team (Patrouille de France).  
 - forum (in french) : http://equipe-flightgear.forumactif.com/  
 - repository : https://sourceforge.net/projects/pafteam/  

Below are screenshots from flightgear and from a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/rzMN0wDuVSo?t=93) showing the cockpit.

My project covers :  
 - the drawings used for cutting the MDF sheets and build the cockpit,  
 - the circuit diagrams and PCBs,  
 - the code used in the microcontrollers (ESP-32 and Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro) for the inputs and outputs,  
 - the code used in the Raspberry Pi Zero W for displaying the canvas on the screen.  
 
 In the folder Electronics, you can find the backup files from EasyEDA.com. The project is available on https://easyeda.com/arnaud.dessein
